            <h2>Love & Care</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Simply stroking your cat, from nose to tail, gives an all-over feel-good massage that lowers 
            a cat's blood pressure and yours. Pay special attention to the places he likes best, such as the 
            base of the tail and under the cheeks. Touching, petting, and massaging your cat also serves as a 
            well-cat check to find any fur mats, lumps or bumps, or sores that may need medical attention.</p>

            <h2>Anger</h2>
            <br>
            <p> You can try to interrupt your cat‚Äôs aggressive behavior by distracting them. You can shake a jar of 
            coins, throw a small toy in their direction or lightly squirt them with a small water gun. Try to avoid 
            shaking their food or treat pouch, as this is a reward and your cat will think acting mean will get them 
            more treats in the future.</p>

            <h2>Cuteness</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Cats have a unique kind of cuteness. They show affection through their large green eyes, they depict 
            playfulness by chasing laser lights and toy spiders, and they become a part of your home (read: furniture)
            by lying on their backs with their legs perched up in the air.</p>
