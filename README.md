# Magic-Paw-Cat-Clinic-website
It is a static page for a cats' clinic with a small transition when loading the page. It is direct practice on HTML and CSS


## This will be my last static page because I am now on my first step in building my webpage using JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS ðŸ˜‰

This web page is my second task in web devlopment Course offered by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetaAcademy.B">Beta Academy</a>.

The main page to run is index.html

### Notes:
 â€¢ The page is static because no Java Script code is used only styling is used for only practice.
 â€¢ But I added a small transition animation on loading the page.(New feature wasn't in my last project <a href="https://github.com/BasmaElhoseny01/Jumpin-Beans-Cafe-Website">Jumpin Beans Cafe Website</a>. )Later I will update it with more actions :) <br>
 â€¢ The buttons in the header are links but are directed to nothing. Only the links in the footer are directed to my social media accounts.
